-count fork times when pipes 
-waiting on child processes 
-we close everything after heredoc exec
-



- if you pass &status as the second param , you'll get the exit
status of the last command 

- we need to redirect stdin and stdout as in we can redirect the command's out
the next command in chain 

- what the shell does when we execute : ls -l | sort for example 
-we use pipe to create a new pipe , the pipe fds are inherited by the
children when we fork twice , we have 2 processes in this case 
- the first processe's read channel is closed and then we call dup2 with
the pipe's write channel and stdout ,to make writing to stdout equivalent 
to writing to the pipe, ls writes to stdout but since we have a pipe 
it writes to it instead 
-in the second process the reverse happens , we call dup2 to read from the pipe's 
read channel instead of stdin 
-when we call dup2(a,b) , b is closed if necessary  and then b is made
to refer to the same entry table as a , multiple fds can point to the same entry
and thats what happens in our case when you duplicate a fd, writing to a or b will
end up writing to the same file.
