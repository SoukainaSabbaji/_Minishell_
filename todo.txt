how heredoc is handled :
-its checked and executed in the checknonfork function
-it then gets to execute the command if its paired with analyzer
-fd_in and her_in values are changed in create_new_command
-when a ctrl d EOF signal is sent to heredoc , it then goes to the execution function
-the same way when it encounters the actual EOF string
- fd = -69 in the case when redirection type is read 
    -there's no create flag so when we try reading a file that
doesnt exist we must return an error
-exit code errors
