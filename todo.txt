-working on :make a function that checks if a function exists to be able to execute it 
need the access command in order to do this job
	-to do this particular task must check if the command exists in the current folder 
if it does i can execute that file straight away , if it doesnt , i cat the name of the command to all of the paths in the PATH variable and test again.

next step is : initializing the pipes
