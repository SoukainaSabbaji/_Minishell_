-made my own export , still imperfect doe
-executing ls (or any command through exec) makes the bootleg bash exit gotta find out why
    -> found out that this is due to the fact that i dont fork yet , it is all done in the main process
-i have to comment the code section responsible for freeing the data, gotta fix this
-gotta make my custom getenv because the system one is non reentrant
-i have an issue with unset , export shows an empty line after using unset
next step is : initializing the pipes
